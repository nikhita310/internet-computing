     <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Nikhita Patil , a software professional and welcome to my blog of travel advice and adventures.<br/>
     I believe To travel is to Live.<br/>
     I love travelling and sharing my experiences about the memories created about each place I visit.
     Beaches , Monuments, Forests, Nature makes me the happiest.
     Visiting different places, meeting new people, tasting the local cuisine and shopping is what I love doing on repeat.
     I aspire to travel all around the world and check off places from my travel bucketlist.
